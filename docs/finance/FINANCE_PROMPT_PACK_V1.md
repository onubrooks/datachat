# Finance Prompt Pack v1 (End-User Demo Script)

Use this pack to run a consistent finance demo from start to finish.

Prerequisites:

1. Seed fintech data (`scripts/fintech_seed.sql`).
2. Sync fintech datapoints (`datapoints/examples/fintech_bank`).
3. In UI, set:
   - **Target database** = fintech connection
   - **Workflow mode** = `Finance Brief v1`

---

## How to Run

1. Run prompts in order from `P01` to `P20`.
2. For each prompt, record:
   - did answer complete without clarification loop?
   - were sources shown?
   - were drivers + caveats present?
3. Fill `reports/finance_workflow_scorecard.csv` and run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/finance_workflow_gate.py \
  --scorecard reports/finance_workflow_scorecard.csv \
  --report-json reports/finance_workflow_gate.json
```

## Clarification Recovery Replies (Copy/Paste)

If a prompt asks for more detail, reply with one of these:

- `Use public.bank_transactions for transaction-level calculations.`
- `Use amount as the transaction value and status='posted' unless stated otherwise.`
- `Use public.bank_loans and public.bank_loan_payments for loan risk and repayment analysis.`
- `Use bank_accounts joined to bank_customers for segment and country breakdowns.`

## Demo Flow (Recommended)

1. Start with `P01` and `P02` (executive liquidity story).
2. Run `P03` + `P04` (operations risk story).
3. Run `P05` + `P06` + `P16` (credit risk story).
4. Run `P07` + `P08` + `P17` (profitability + concentration story).
5. Use `P20` to close with a leadership-ready summary.
