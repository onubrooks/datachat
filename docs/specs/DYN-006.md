# DYN-006: Domain Subagents and Skills

**Initiative ID:** DYN-006  
**Status:** Planned  
**Phase:** Phase D (Dynamic Data Agent Productization)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

Complex domains require specialized behavior. A single generic agent degrades on tasks that need domain-specific planning, validation, and workflows.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Define domain subagent contract (inputs, outputs, policy envelope).
- Add skill packaging format for reusable domain workflows.
- Route tasks to subagents based on intent/domain classification.

Out of scope:

- Arbitrary third-party subagent execution without validation.
- Unbounded nesting of autonomous subagent chains.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Implement subagent registry with capability and policy metadata.
- Add skill manifests with step definitions and guardrails.
- Integrate planner handoff and verifier callbacks for subagent outputs.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- Add subagent invocation and skill manifest schemas.
- Extend trace model with parent/child step linkage.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- Persist subagent run metadata, skill version, and outcomes.
- Store skill definitions with versioned compatibility fields.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Restrict subagent capabilities by policy class.
- Require deterministic failure boundaries and escalation paths.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [ ] Planner can invoke approved domain subagents for matched tasks.
- [ ] Skill runs are traceable with version and policy context.

Quality:

- [ ] Subagent handoffs do not regress baseline answer correctness.
- [ ] Failure isolation and fallback paths are deterministic.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: subagent routing/classification and skill manifest validation tests.
- integration: parent planner + subagent execution and callback flows.
- manual: run domain workflows and inspect full parent/child trace.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Launch with a limited set of internal subagents and curated skills.

Rollback:

- Disable subagent routing and process tasks with core planner only.

## 10. Open Questions

- What minimum quality bar is required for a new domain subagent?
- How should skills be promoted from experimental to stable?
