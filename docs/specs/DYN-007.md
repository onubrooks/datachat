# DYN-007: Dynamic-Agent Eval Gates and Operational Scorecards

**Initiative ID:** DYN-007  
**Status:** Planned  
**Phase:** Phase D (Dynamic Data Agent Productization)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

Dynamic execution increases capability and risk. Without dedicated evaluation gates and operational scorecards, regressions in safety, quality, or cost become difficult to control.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Define dynamic-agent eval suites (planning quality, verifier fidelity, safety compliance).
- Add operational scorecards for latency, cost, success rate, and intervention rate.
- Gate releases on dynamic-agent quality and safety thresholds.

Out of scope:

- Full autonomous optimization that changes gates automatically.
- External compliance certification workflows.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Build benchmark scenarios for dynamic multi-step tasks.
- Add CI and release pipelines that run dynamic-agent scorecards.
- Publish scorecard snapshots tied to model/prompt/runtime versions.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- Define scorecard schema and threshold config contract.
- Add run metadata fields for dynamic-agent route versions.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- Persist benchmark run results with trend history.
- Store release gate decisions and override rationale.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Block release when safety-critical thresholds fail.
- Require explicit approval and audit trail for gate overrides.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [ ] Dynamic-agent eval suites run in CI/release pipelines.
- [ ] Scorecards provide per-dimension pass/fail and trend visibility.

Quality:

- [ ] Release gates prevent deployment on safety-critical regressions.
- [ ] Benchmark coverage reflects representative production tasks.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: scorecard computation and threshold evaluation tests.
- integration: CI/release pipeline gate behavior with fixture regressions.
- manual: review scorecards for two consecutive release candidates.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Start with advisory scorecards, then convert core metrics to blocking gates.

Rollback:

- Revert to advisory-only mode while preserving all scorecard artifacts.

## 10. Open Questions

- Which metrics should become blocking first?
- How should dynamic-agent quality be compared across model upgrades?
