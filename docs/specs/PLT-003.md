# PLT-003: Semantic Accuracy Improvements in Low-Context Mode

**Initiative ID:** PLT-003  
**Status:** Planned  
**Phase:** Phase B (Simplicity and Platform Expansion)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

When metadata coverage is thin, semantic business queries can return lower-confidence or mismatched answers. Low-context mode needs targeted quality improvements.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Improve fallback reasoning for sparse metadata conditions.
- Strengthen clarification strategy for ambiguous business prompts.
- Add confidence calibration and source-quality signaling.

Out of scope:

- Full ontology authoring suite.
- Autonomous metadata generation without review.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Add low-context heuristics and guarded prompt pathways.
- Increase use of governance and telemetry cues in routing decisions.
- Add confidence and evidence quality annotations to responses.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- Extend response metadata with low-context flags and confidence rationale.
- Document clarification policy changes for low-context mode.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- Add low-context outcome markers in telemetry records.
- Expand eval fixtures for sparse metadata scenarios.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Prefer clarification or abstention over confident unsupported claims.
- Enforce explicit evidence disclaimers for low-context responses.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [ ] Low-context queries produce clearer confidence/rationale metadata.
- [ ] Clarification path improves answer correctness for ambiguous prompts.

Quality:

- [ ] Low-context eval suite shows measurable accuracy improvement.
- [ ] Hallucination-like unsupported assertions are reduced in benchmark scenarios.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: confidence calibration and clarification decision tests.
- integration: sparse metadata pipeline tests for semantic prompts.
- manual: evaluate domain question bank prompts under low-context conditions.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Enable low-context enhancements behind feature flag and compare metrics.

Rollback:

- Revert to previous low-context routing/prompt strategy if regressions appear.

## 10. Open Questions

- Which confidence thresholds should trigger mandatory clarification?
- How should evidence-quality warnings be presented in UI and CLI?
