# PLT-002: Deterministic Coverage for Additional Catalog Intents

**Initiative ID:** PLT-002  
**Status:** Planned  
**Phase:** Phase B (Simplicity and Platform Expansion)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

Some catalog and schema-shape intents still route through more expensive or brittle paths. Deterministic coverage expansion is required for predictable performance and accuracy.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Add deterministic handlers for additional catalog intents.
- Improve intent detection for schema-oriented prompts.
- Align outputs across connectors and response channels.

Out of scope:

- Semantic business-metric reasoning improvements.
- Freeform SQL planner redesign.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Extend intent router rules and deterministic operator map.
- Implement connector-specific catalog query templates for new intents.
- Add response normalization layer for deterministic intent outputs.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- Update intent taxonomy docs and deterministic intent matrix.
- Include deterministic intent metadata in answer decision trace.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- No major schema changes.
- Update deterministic intent fixtures and regression corpus.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Keep deterministic handlers read-only and bounded.
- Require explicit fallback if deterministic coverage is unavailable.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [ ] Additional catalog intents execute via deterministic path.
- [ ] Fallback behavior is explicit and traceable when unsupported.

Quality:

- [ ] Intent regression suite includes new deterministic cases.
- [ ] Latency and accuracy improve on schema-intent benchmark set.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: intent classification and operator mapping tests.
- integration: deterministic catalog flow tests across connectors.
- manual: verify representative schema questions resolve without clarification churn.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Roll out intents incrementally by confidence and connector readiness.

Rollback:

- Disable affected deterministic intents and route through existing fallback.

## 10. Open Questions

- Which intents should be prioritized by observed user frequency?
- Should connector-specific behavior be surfaced in user-facing metadata?
