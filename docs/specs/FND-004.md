# FND-004: Governance Metadata APIs

**Initiative ID:** FND-004  
**Status:** Planned  
**Phase:** Phase A (Foundation Stabilization)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

Governance context (freshness, lineage, quality ownership) is not consistently exposed as a first-class API surface. Agents infer governance cues indirectly, which reduces answer reliability.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Expose governance metadata via stable API endpoints.
- Include freshness and lineage payloads consumable by planner/retriever.
- Define contracts for data quality metadata fields.

Out of scope:

- External governance platform integration adapters.
- Auto-remediation workflows for governance violations.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Add read endpoints for governance metadata by dataset/table/metric.
- Include freshness timestamp, upstream sources, owner, and quality status.
- Wire governance context into retrieval and answer synthesis stage inputs.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- New governance metadata endpoint family under API v1.
- Versioned response schema with backward-compatible defaults.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- Extend metadata storage/index model with governance fields.
- Add lineage relation records where available.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Mark unknown governance values explicitly; never infer as fresh/valid.
- Preserve source provenance for every governance datum.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [ ] Governance endpoints return freshness/lineage/owner for covered entities.
- [ ] Agent pipeline can consume governance payloads without custom parsing.

Quality:

- [ ] API contracts are documented and schema-tested.
- [ ] Unknown or stale metadata is surfaced deterministically in responses.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: schema serialization/deserialization and fallback behavior tests.
- integration: API endpoint tests against fixture metadata store.
- manual: inspect governance fields in retrieval traces for representative prompts.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Release endpoints as additive API; integrate read path in planner after validation.

Rollback:

- Feature flag governance consumption while keeping endpoint availability.

## 10. Open Questions

- Which governance fields are mandatory at launch?
- How should lineage confidence be represented when partial?
