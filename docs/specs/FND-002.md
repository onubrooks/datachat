# FND-002: Metadata Authoring Lifecycle Controls

**Initiative ID:** FND-002  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Phase:** Phase A (Foundation Stabilization)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

Even valid metadata can conflict or degrade without lifecycle controls. DataPoint ownership, review, and version semantics are currently under-specified, leading to silent overrides and trust issues.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Define ownership and review requirements for managed/user DataPoints.
- Add version and change-reason metadata on updates.
- Add duplicate/conflict detection during sync.

Out of scope:

- Enterprise RBAC model across multiple teams.
- Full workflow automation for approvals in external systems.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Introduce lifecycle fields: owner, reviewer, version, changed_by, changed_reason.
- Require explicit conflict resolution strategy for duplicate semantic definitions.
- Add lifecycle checks to sync and ingestion commands.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- Extend DataPoint contract with lifecycle metadata block.
- Add conflict response schema for duplicate semantic keys.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- Persist DataPoint version metadata with index records.
- Record conflict decisions in audit trail.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Prevent silent replacement of canonical definitions.
- Preserve auditability of metadata provenance and updates.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [x] Sync rejects conflicting DataPoints unless resolution mode is provided.
- [x] Lifecycle metadata is captured and queryable for every update.

Quality:

- [x] Conflict resolution paths have deterministic behavior and tests.
- [x] Audit entries are generated for create/update/override actions.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: lifecycle field validation and conflict resolver policy tests.
- integration: sync scenarios with duplicate concepts and controlled overrides.
- manual: simulate user and managed DataPoint collision workflow.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Ship lifecycle metadata as optional, then enforce required fields after migration.

Rollback:

- Disable hard conflict blocking while retaining lifecycle logging.

## 10. Open Questions

- How should canonical ownership be assigned for cross-domain concepts?
- Should conflict policy be global or namespace-specific?
