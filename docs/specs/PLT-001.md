# PLT-001: Runtime Connector Expansion

**Initiative ID:** PLT-001  
**Status:** Planned  
**Phase:** Phase B (Simplicity and Platform Expansion)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## 1. Problem

Runtime support is limited to currently integrated engines. Expanding connectors is required to support broader production environments.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Add runtime-grade connectors for prioritized engines (for example BigQuery and Redshift).
- Implement schema/catalog operations parity with existing connectors.
- Ensure routing, policy, and telemetry compatibility for new connectors.

Out of scope:

- One-off prototype connectors without test and observability parity.
- Multi-region federation orchestration.

## 3. Proposed Design

- Implement connector adapter interfaces and capability descriptors.
- Add engine-specific SQL dialect handling where needed.
- Extend integration test matrix for connector parity checks.

## 4. API and Contract Changes

- Update connector capability contracts and registry metadata.
- Document connector-specific constraints in API/CLI docs.

## 5. Data Model and Storage Changes

- Add connector config fields for engine-specific auth/options.
- Persist connector capability metadata for route selection.

## 6. Safety and Policy

- Enforce least-privilege connection scopes for each connector.
- Validate that connector-specific operations respect policy classes.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

Functional:

- [ ] New connectors support core catalog and query workflows.
- [ ] Target-database routing works consistently across old and new connectors.

Quality:

- [ ] Connector integration suites pass with parity to existing engines.
- [ ] Error handling uses normalized connector error taxonomy.

## 8. Test Plan

- unit: connector adapter and dialect translation tests.
- integration: end-to-end ask/schema/sample flows on each new connector.
- manual: environment setup and smoke runs for each connector.

## 9. Rollout and Rollback

Rollout:

- Release connectors behind capability flags and staged environment rollout.

Rollback:

- Disable specific connector in registry without impacting other engines.

## 10. Open Questions

- Which connector order maximizes user impact first?
- Are engine-specific governance metadata fields needed at launch?
