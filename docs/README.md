# DataChat Docs

This directory contains product and engineering documentation for DataChat.

## Implementation Snapshot (February 2026)

Implemented now:

- credentials-only querying with deterministic catalog intelligence
- DataPoint-enhanced retrieval and answer synthesis
- multi-database registry with `target_database` routing
- tool registry/execution with policy checks and typed parameter schemas
- profiling pipeline that generates pending DataPoints for review

Planned (not yet implemented as full product features):

- workspace/folder indexing and codebase understanding workflows
- runtime connectors for BigQuery/Redshift
- Levels 3-5 automation features

## Document Map

Planning hierarchy:
